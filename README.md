# Conky Themes

This is a collection of themes I've either created, or modified heavily from other Conky Themes out there.

If you want to install them, do so by moving all the files in the respective `theme-name` to your desired location, either in `~/.config/conky` or elsewhere.

The `start.sh` is just a handy way for you to add it to your OS's startup applications.
